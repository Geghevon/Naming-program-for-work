This is a simple program that reads table footbal players' names from names file, time of the game from time file, 
and the graphic from the graphic file also in the last line of the graphic file there must be the day of the games.
Using this information the program creates the names of the games' videos and writes them into video_names file.
This program was created to make easier our work.
